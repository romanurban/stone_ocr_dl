# Preprocessing Module

This folder contains scripts and utilities for preprocessing images.

## Usage

1. Import preprocessing functions in your Python scripts:
   ```python
   from stone_ocr.preprocessing import <function_name>
   ```
2. Apply preprocessing functions to your images before passing them to the OCR pipeline:
   ```python
   processed_image = <function_name>(raw_image)
   ```
3. Integrate preprocessing as the first step in your OCR workflow.

## Notes
- See the source code in this folder for available preprocessing functions and their documentation.
- Adjust preprocessing parameters as needed for your dataset and OCR requirements.
